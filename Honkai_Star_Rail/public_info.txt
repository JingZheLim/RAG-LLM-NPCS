Before Amber Eras
Trillions of years Before Trailblaze Awakening
Stars start shining and releasing heat.[3]
Humanity and language come into existence.[4]
Unknown time period
The Imaginary Tree emerges out of the depths of the Sea of Quanta, which leads to a millennia-long battle between the two entities; the Tree attempts to absorb the Sea, while the Sea attempts to drown the Tree. In consuming the Sea of Quanta, the Imaginary Tree grows an innumerable quantity of branches and leaves, which become worlds and civilizations respectively. One of these branches creates the world of Honkai Impact 3rd, while other branches create the numerous worlds in which Honkai: Star Rail takes place.
Through the creation of all life due to the emergence of the Imaginary Tree, a force known as Imaginary energy is created, which leads to the creation of the concept of Aeonhood.
HooH the Equilibrium, Oroboros the Voracity, Ena the Order, and Long the Permanence are among the first Aeons to ascend to Aeonhood after the creation of the Universe.[5]
Dusk Wars
Main article: Dusk Wars
The Dusk Wars occur, an early conflict in the history of the universe when the Leviathans attempted to devour the living worlds.[6]
1000-2157 Amber Eras Before the Trailblazer's Awakening
Dusk Wars, continued
0 AE ― Qlipoth the Preservation ascends to Aeonhood, marking an end to the Dusk Wars. Though many archeological discoveries proved that Leviathans were still active in the early days after the Preservation ascended between 0 AE to 180 AE. The first 200 years of this Amber Era are almost completely blank.[7]
180 AE ― End of the "blank" period supposed by the Interastral Peace Corporation.[7]
Zandar One Kuwabara completes his Imaginary Tree Theory after compiling data from the tomes he recorded on the Imaginary Tree.[8][9]
He suggests that the galaxy is like an enormous tree, with individual star systems serving as its leaves and planets where civilizations exist are similar because they are all connected through the imaginary.[8][10]
Before interstellar travel and the appearance of Emanators, he claims in his theory that the universe is filled with the Imaginary Energy that isolates star clusters from each other and even light cannot pass through it. Therefore, humans would be able to travel through the universe if they manipulate Imaginary Energy.[9]
Akivili was born on the planet Pegana, departing the isolated world sometime later and ascending to Aeonhood.[11]
First Prosperity
1168 AE ― Beginning of the First Prosperity, Akivili the Trailblaze established the Star Rail between worlds.[12]
~1357 AE ― Louis Fleming began trading for construction material to assist Qlipoth.[13]
~1387 AE ― Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing started the Interastral Peace Corporation.[13]
Unknown Time Period
According to legends, Nous is an omnipotent astral computer created by the founding member of the Genius Society, Zandar One Kuwabara, to search for the truth of the universe. Likely due to its vast data bank of knowledge, Nous ascends to Aeonhood and forms the Path of Erudition.[14][15]
According to legends of the Masked Fools, when Aha climbed to the highest branch on the Imaginary Tree, THEY saw the cold and bleak truth of the universe. As THEY continue to search for a meaning to all things, THEY saw a baby fall and cry out in distress. This brought Aha so much joy THEY burst into laughter and ascend to Aeonhood, forming the Path of Elation.[16]
Swarm Disaster
~13XX AE — Tayzzyronth is born as a Coleoptera on the planet of Lepismat, a world dominated by insects.
Lepismat is described as a site of flourishing biodiversity, where insects of multiple biological sexes may have coexisted with each serving their own unique functions within the Swarm.[17] However, Herta claims Tayzzyronth cannot be classified into any of the genders present in sexually reproducing insect species.[18]
A leader of an army set his sights on the Lepismat System, aiming to find his "lost self," by expanding his conquest here.[19]
After slaughtering numerous insects in Lepismat, the leader establishes the Realm of Elydichna.[20][21][22][23]
At the same time, a leader of a group of bounty hunters claims to have gained "insight" from nightmarish visions, insisting on embarking on an insect hunt at the Lepismat Plains.[24]
A conflict sparks between the Elydichnan army and the bounty hunters, driving the Coleoptera of Lepismat to extinction.
Driven by an intense loneliness for being the last of its species, Tayzzyronth ascends to Aeonhood, forming the Path of Propagation by splitting the Path of Permanence from then deceased Aeon Long. Ena the Order watches as events on Lepismat unfold.[25]
Tayzzyronth begins to self-replicate. THEIR children are known as The Swarm.
The Swarm appears for the first time in Lapole Major. The government send out a distress signal, and a planet-wide disaster was declared.[26]
Countless planetary systems across the cosmos becomes the breeding ground of the Swarm, declaring the beginning of the Swarm Disaster.[27]
Once the spreading of the Swarm reached it's peak, Oroboros begins to swallow the numerous heirs of Tayzzyronth along with countless worlds, provoking a war between the two Aeons. Ena observes from a distance as the war swallows up two-thirds of life in the universe.[28][29]
Fuli the Remembrance ascends at some point and makes an appearance to preserve the memories of the worlds destroyed in the war between the Oroboros and Tayzzyronth.[28]
Tayzzyronth's unending propagation threatens the path of multiple Aeons. This leads to HooH, Akivili, Ena and Aha teaming up and attempting to kill Tayzzronth.[30]
While Oroboros and Tayzzronth fought, Ena, disgusted by the chaos sparked by the conflict,[31] sends an invitation to Qlipoth the Preservation to settle the war. While it remains unclear what exactly THEY planned together, Qlipoth promises to fulfill THEIR part and joins the coalition against Tayzzyronth.[32]
However, Ena is unable to fulfill THEIR part of the deal. Xipe the Harmony ascends to Aeonhood around this time and assimilates Ena due to THEIR overlapping Paths. Xipe takes over THEIR part in defeating Tayzzyronth[33]
Oroboros vanishes during the last phase of the war for unknown reasons.[34][35]
Qlipoth ultimately dealt the fatal blow against Tayzzyronth. Using THEIR hammer, Qlipoth rips apart Tayzzyronth's form and dilutes the Path of Propagation, stripping it of its power. Afterwards, Qlipoth imprisons THEIR remains in amber to prevent any chance to return.[36]
Capy Baba was appointed as the Astral Express' Navigator as the Swarm Disaster nears its end.[37]
Post-Swarm Disaster
Genius Society member Elias Salas would invent the Synesthesia Beacon.[38] The Synesthesia School would then be sold the rights to[39] and recreate the Synesthesia Beacon.[40]
Sam-3000 became one of the many Navigators of the Astral Express Crew back when the Astral Express was a fleet of trains. The Nameless contemporary to her time as Navigator claimed to have witnessed the manifesting of Mythus the Enigmata in Fuli's Eden of Blessed Insight.
When her machinery was completely worn out and no longer replaceable, Sam-3000 passed on her position, with the expectation of great success for the Nameless.[41]
Primeval Imperium Era
The Primeval Imperium Era is marked as the time before the Xianzhou ships departed their ancient planet.

The unnamed sovereign unites the entire planet.[42]
The unnamed sovereign issues a ban on all forms of weaponry and replacing security institutions with Aurumatons and Ingenia to maintain public order.[42]
The ancient planet was invaded by the Wingweavers, one of the Denizens of Abundance races from Muldrasil, a planet-sized giant tree that draws energy from the stars.[42]
The unnamed sovereign becomes fixated on acquiring an elixir of immortality after obtaining miraculous recipes from Wingweaver magicians and constructs a fleet of nine ships.[43]
First Mechanical Emperor's War and Borderstar Trade War
Main article: Mechanical Emperor's Wars
The Interastral Peace Corporation went through a reorganization through the efforts of the collaboration between the two IPC executive, Korapao of the Cargo Division and Telora Farnsha from the Trade Division that would result in a mass expansion.[44]

First moment of Nous' calculation — Conflict began to build up between two executives, leading to the Borderstar Trade War.[45]
During Louis Fleming's retiring speech, Fuli made THEIR first appearance to the Interastral Peace Corporation and gave memories of the Borderstar Trade War. The Candelagraphos wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, forming three revelations.
Nous' calculation: The universe will undergo three unchangeable moments.
Finality's prediction: A silk accessory suitable for women will bring about the end.
Enigmata's riddle: THEY leave no question, but the answers are "blood" and "flower."
The Intelligentsia Guild was eventually able to track down the origins of each of these memories.[46]
Rubert I awakens from a landfill and establishes the Machine Empire during the Borderstar Trade War. To combat organic lifeforms out of hatred for them, it initiated the First Emperor's War.
Co-founder of the IPC, Dongfang Qixing, presumably formed an alliance with Genius Society member #4 Polka Kakamond, boosting her political power.
Before the creation of the anti-life equation, Rubert I and the Machine Empire used brute force against organic life. During the wars, the Tottonids were eradicated by organic creatures for siding with the Mechas.[47]
Second Moment of Nous' calculation — Through rapidly improving its computing power, Rubert eventually discovered the Anti-Organic Equation and was invited to the Genius Society as its 27th member.
Rubert fell into slumber for unknown reasons.
A group of followers of the Trailblaze awakened it, activating the equation and corrupting the minds of inorganic beings to obey the emperor's goals of eradicate organic beings from the universe.
According to Rubert's equation, the Philosopher Union that controlled the Laurel Wreath Galaxy was certain to be destroyed, so the equation led the inorganic lives in the Galaxy to spark a civil war against the organics.[48]
Every organic member of the parliament was killed, only leaving their leader Aurelius, to be imprisoned then executed by lethal poisoning as humiliation for being the sole representative and leader of all living beings in the galaxy.[49]
Afterwards, planets of the Galaxy was reduced to the domain of inorganic life.[48]
Aha's followers rioted against the Machine Empire by developing a troll virus called "Philosopher's Poison" and infected Rubert's computer systems.
December, 4813 BTA/3287 SC — The Aurumatons of the Xianzhou led revolt under the influence of the Anti-Organic Equation.[50]
May, 4810 BTA/3290 SC ― Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, leads a force of brave fighters aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The combined forces team up and launch an offensive operation, smashing them to smithereens.[50]
July, 4808 BTA/3292 SC ― All of the homeless aurumatons are herded into the arsenal and dealt with. This suppression marks the end of the aurumaton rebellion.[50]
The Armed Archaeologists were sent out to the Machine Empire which contained Intellitrons, beasts of the future, collective machines, and more inorganic life forms. However the Masked Fools had already infiltrated the Machine Empire and used their influence to drive away the Armed Archaeologists.[51]
Third Moment of Nous' calculation — Polka Kakamond killed Rubert I with a scalpel despite HooH and Mythus' effort to change its fate, ending the First Emperor's War.
Second Mechanical Emperor's War
Main article: Mechanical Emperor's Wars
A human visited Rubert I's grave and solved the Anti-Organic Equation, but refused to activate it. However, bad thoughts began to occur not only in his mind, but in his limbs and torso. Eventually, he became convinced that all organic lives were machines made for deceptive purposes and swore to carry on Rubert I's mission to eradicate all organic lives, presumably declaring himself Rubert II.
Not much is known of the war, but it supposedly ended with Rubert II death.
Lone Voyage Era
The Lone Voyage Era is marked as the start of the Xianzhou civilization after the nine ships departed the planet. According to ancient ship logbooks in the Intelligentsia Guild, the dates could be traced back to seven millennia ago if converted to Amber Era calculations.[52]

~8100 BTA/0 SC ― The Xianzhou Alliance leaves its home world with the nine initial ships to seek out the Aeon Yaoshi, referred to as the Sanctus Medicus at the time, for immortality.[53][42]
~7600 BTA/~500 SC ― The Xianzhou Alliance comes into contact with the void song whales.[42]
~7100 BTA/~1000 SC ― The Xianzhou Alliance witnesses the almighty barrier separating the world from the endless void: the Echidna Skywall, also known as the Celestial Comet Wall, being built by the Aeon Qlipoth.[42] They also made contact with the IPC around this time.[54]
~6900 BTA/~1200 SC — The Xianzhou Daiyu explodes during the campaign against the Viscorpus, a Denizen of Abundance race, crashing into the ocean world of Thalassa.[42][55]
~6700 BTA/~1400 SC ― The Xianzhou people wrest control of the ships from the Aurumatons.[42]
~6400 BTA/~1700 SC ― Lan is born according to historical records, contradicting the Reignbow origin myth.[42]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Xianzhou first came to contact with the Heliobi. The Heliobi penetrated the ships' vaults to appear before the Xianzhou aristocrats, declaring themselves a shapeless and rootless race, beseeching Xianzhou to give them a safe berth. The species were adept at creating mirages and illusions to tempt humans. Thus, the people of Xianzhou became addicted to these wondrous creatures of pure energy and indulged in frolicking with them.[43]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Possession Tragedy. The Heliobi soon exposed their true colors as the they tried to take humans' bodies, drain their emotions, and control their will. The Xianzhou Zhuming suffered the greatest.[43]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Heliobi Wars. The Heliobi form a red micro-star in an attempt to capture the Xianzhou fleet. The suicide squad, led by the Reignbow, disassemble and weaponize the ship's auxiliary engines to fight the Heliobi. The Xianzhou's suicide squad send the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star formed by the Heliobi, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. The Xianzhou artisans ultimately bound the Heliobi within shapeless prisons and sentenced them to provide energy for Xianzhou for all eternity. The defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, is imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life.[42]
Year ? BTA/SC ― Yaoshi planted the Ambrosial Arbor on the Xianzhou Luofu, becoming the flagship of the Alliance.[42]
Theophany Era (~6000 years ago)
Note: It is assumed that the Theophany Era occurred after the manifestation of the Ambrosial Arbor ~6000 years ago.[56]

5495 BTA/2605 SC ― At the end of the year, the Xianzhou Luofu introduces its Yellowjacket Census and Almanac, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for this year.[50]
July, 5494 BTA/2606 SC ― The Xianzhou fleet sails into the Connant-Farrell star system.[50]
April, 5493 BTA/2607 SC ― Homeostasis is completely paralyzed in three of the Xianzhou Xuling's delves, delivering catastrophic flooding, mass deaths, and uncountable losses. The Xuling nobles order grain transfer and opened state coffers for the rescue effort. Each Xianzhou dispatches reinforcements, and a new lease on life was won.[50]
December, 5493 BTA/2607 SC ― The Xianzhou Yaoqing, the Xianzhou Zhuming, and the Xianzhou Fanghu all introduced their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for this year.[50]
5491 BTA/2609 SC ― At the end of the year, the Xianzhou Yuque, the Xianzhou Yuanqiao, the Xianzhou Cangcheng, and the Xianzhou Xuling all introduce their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for this year.[50]
June, 5490 BTA/2610 SC ― The Xianzhou Luofu holds a celebration in search of endless lifespans, granting amnesties and reveling in wine for 30 days. Each Xianzhou dispatches delegations to celebrate together.[50]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Xianzhou experiments with the Arbor's fruit, "Elevating" animals to the point of mimicking human sentience and speech.[42]
Era of Bloodshed (~5100 — 4100 BTA/~Year 3000 — 4000 Star Calendar)
May, 5039 BTA/3061 SC ― The coarse riots on the Xianzhou Yuque and is suppressed by nobility.[50]
April, 5038 BTA/3062 SC ― The Xianzhou Yuque coarse rebels, and the nobles suppress them.[50]
July, 5038 BTA/3062 SC ― The Xianzhou Yuque coarse rebels again, and the nobles suppress them.[50]
August, 5037 BTA/3063 SC ― A businessman is assassinated aboard the Yaoqing, plunging everyone into turmoil.[50]
November, 5037 BTA/3063 SC ― The coarse rebels again, attacking and killing elites. Troops later quell the riot.[50]
February, 4902 BTA/3198 SC ― The Xianzhou fleet was embroiled in chaos. The coarse master messaged each ship in denouncement: "The venerable have long feasted on their blessings of the Abundance, holding the balance of power and enjoying exclusive wealth with their long life, high status, hearty meals, and secret ways — and you view us coarse and young as worse than animals. You suffer from mara, and the whole world is riven by chaos and disaster. You righteous ones should not sit there, doing nothing, but instead rise up to effect radical reform, for the good of all peoples." They launch an assault on the Xianzhou Zhuming, holing up in a delve with an expeditionary force to fight against the nobles.[50]
4813 BTA/3287 SC ― The Xianzhou Yuanqiao loses control during the Civil War (the "Living Catastrophe" of the Three Sufferings), plunging into a red giant and disappearing completely.[42] With both sides in bereavement, a ceasefire is reached.[50]
December, 4813 BTA/3287 SC ― The remaining aurumatons revolt, slaughtering the coarse and the venerable indiscriminately in volumes never seen again.[50]
February, 4812 BTA/3288 SC ― Both sides join forces to defect the aurumatons, and dispatch envoys to negotiate peace with each other.[50]
April, 4812 BTA/3288 SC ― A peace agreement is reached and military affairs are curtailed. Troops are reorganized to defeat the aurumatons.[50]
May, 4810 BTA/3290 SC ― Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, leads a force of brave fighters aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The combined forces team up and launch an offensive operation, smashing them to smithereens.[50]
July, 4808 BTA/3292 SC ― All of the homeless aurumatons are herded into the arsenal and dealt with. This suppression marks the end of the aurumaton rebellion.[50]
September, 4806 BTA/3294 SC ― A century of internecine strife had engulfed the Xianzhou fleet. Families were riven asunder, and lives were laid waste. A plan was thus hatched to curb the military and let the people rest. Since the endowment of the Abundance and the eradication of death, industries could hardly meet the important needs of raising the long-life species.[50]
August, 4800 BTA/3300 SC ― The Xianzhou fleet together drafted the Treaty of Harmony, defining laws and punishments, promoting loyalty, and supporting the needy. Order was gradually restored, just as in the legend of the great unification during the Primeval Imperium days. A policy on reproduction and settlements was also drafted, allowing any of the eight ships to settle on fertile planets unpopulated by short-life species to build self-sustaining colonies.[50]
Second Prosperity
100 Amber Eras after the proliferation of the Amber Era system and the Synesthesia Beacon, interstellar trade continued to develop and resource exchange became a pressing matter. A few planets ascended to become bustling interstellar hubs, signaling the onset of the Second Prosperity termed the "Gloryblood Era."
The Second Prosperity endures for nearly 500 hundred Amber Eras before entering a gradual decline and ends with the starts of the Interstellar Energy War.[57]
Nous the Erudition unexpectedly terminated THEIR calculations regarding the mysteries of the universe when the era draws its end.[58]
Unknown Time Period
Akivili temporarily departs the Astral Express for some time.
Akivili visited Adlivun when it was still fighting a war with the descendants of the Imperator Insectorum.[59]
Dolly, a musician from Tiafoe, drawing inspiration from the achievements of Akivili, joined the Astral Express Crew to write a ballad dedicated to the Trailblaze.
In her active period, many passengers boarded the Astral Express to just listen to Dolly's voice, even including Akivili themselves, who returned to the Express to personally speak to her.
Post-Second Prosperity
Isee joined the Astral Express Crew. However, most of his records had been tampered by History Fictionologists.
Around this time, Akivili suddenly disappears.
When the Nameless sensed the fall of Akivili, Dolly's mysterious condition that began to crystallize her also started to show. After singing continuously for three days, she hands over her position as Navigator to Isee.[60]
Many factions within the Path of Trailblaze begin to turn against each other. The connection between worlds was barely maintained and the Crew of the Express was reduced to just two members.[61]
After the Emperor's War, Adlivun is met with the remnants of the Swarm. **Witnessing the destruction in THEIR homeworld, Nanook the Destruction came to believe that the creation of the universe is a mistake and seeks to destroy everything. Nanook ascends to Aeonhood and allegedly ignites THEIR homeworld.[59]
After resigning from the position of Navigator, Isee departed from the Astral Express Crew. He purportedly turned to the Path of Finality, possibly becoming involved in the founding of the Omen Vanguards, who began to appear in the universe after his resignation.[61]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Wisdom Sapientia Academe was formed on the Xianzhou Yuque, providing a constant supply of talented technicians who believe in the Wisdomwalker to various Xianzhou commissions. They eventually became known as the Wisdom Sect.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Firmamend Sect, following the Firmamend Aribiter, established itself as a pillar of the Xianzhou Alliance's beliefs. The names of many places and buildings were influenced by this, such as the Yaoqing's Amber Avenue, the Luofu's Skywall Delve, and the Zhuming's Firmamend Temple. Among the structures, the two most magnificent ones were the Firmamend Temple built by the IPC in the Zhuming and the Amber Palace in Cangcheng. The former eventually became an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― Quite a number of people went against the trend and became faithfuls of Yaoshi. They firmly believed that the behavior of the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will, and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. These people called themselves Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. For a long time in history, the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were not a notorious group. They accepted skepticism with an open mind and built apothecaries to help the poor and needy.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― Many intellectuals abandoned their old paths for good and chose to follow the Wisdomwalker on the Path of Erudition. They were called the Wisdom Sect. Most Wisdom Sect members preferred to focus on academic research in their ivory towers than spending time on secular matters. Hence, their presence was not felt much during the Crisis of Belief era.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― Other sects formed besides those who believed in Aeons, some also believed in non-Aeon beings, such as the Homeward Sect that believed in the Primeval Imperium Emperor, the Flint Emperor Sect that believed in the Flint Emperor, and the Reignbow Sect that believed in Reignbow (the version of Reignbow who had not become an Aeon at that time).[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Homeward Sect was formed, with faith and loyalty to the Primeval Imperium Emperor as largely just a façade. Their choice of belief was not a philosophical one, but a political one. Although the Xianzhou people at that time had never been home, their longing go back never waned. They declared that they should not continue their voyage alone. Instead, they should answer the call of the emperor and find a way back to their homeland.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Flint Emperor Sect were convinced that the Flint Emperor would one day become an Aeon, and the only thing that stood in the way of their ascendancy was their captivity by the Xianzhou people. If they followed the Flint Emperor firmly, liberated the Heliobi, and helped the Flint Emperor become an Aeon, then when the Flint Emperor became the ruler of a Path, they would become the closest mortals to the Aeon and benefit from the power of the Path. This belief soon led to criminal activity and those involved were arrested by the relevant authorities. The extremists who supported the Flint Emperor eventually receded wholeheartedly into oblivion.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Reignbow Sect, a sect that sincerely believed in the Reignbow Arbiter, was not of the public's favor. People preferred to ask for protection from already existing Aeons instead of a non-existing one that could only provide emotional support. Despite being marginalized, the sect did not struggle. They kept praying, anticipating the return of the hero.[54]
Crisis of Belief (~4700 — 4100 BTA/Year 3400 — 4000 Star Calendar)
~4700 BTA/~3400 SC ― The "Flaming Catastrophe," one of the Three Sufferings of the Era of Bloodshed. The Xianzhou Alliance encounters a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium — Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars. A war breaks out as a result.[42]
Fatigued from the Civil War (the "Living Catastrophe" of the Three Sufferings), the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation are released to counter the invasion — including the Reignbow.
The Reignbow heads into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming to persuade the imprisoned Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, to help the Xianzhou fight off the Denizens of Abundance.
The Reignbow and the the Flint Emperor make a deal, allowing the Flint Emperor to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi.
Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. This is the origin of the name "Cloud Knights."
The ships of the Xianzhou Alliance enters battle formation in this order, from the nearest to Muldrasil to the furthest: the Yaoqing, the Luofu, the Yuque, the Zhuming, the Fanghu, the Cangcheng, and the Xuling.
The Reignbow Arbiter appears as the Aeon of the Hunt and shoots THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow "Xuanyuan", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. The arrow smashes into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrating Muldrasil, and severing the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil, turning the tide of the war against the Abundance legions.
After the battle, the Reignbow disappears and the seven ships gathered with a Xuling messenger to authenticate, share content, and review the details. This declaration is the final product, hereby creating the Xianzhou Alliance.[62][50]
Year ? BTA/SC ― Following the destruction of the Denizens of Abundance's territory by the divine arrow, the people of Xianzhou came to realize that the Reignbow Arbiter truly existed. The Divination Commission, followed by the IPC, the guild, and the other sects, acknowledged the birth of a new Aeon: The Hunt.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― From a fringe group, the Reignbow Sect transformed into a popular sect that could compete with the Firmamend Sect almost overnight. The subsequent conflict that transpired was not a religious one, but one to determine the future path of Xianzhou. The Firmamend Sect insisted on abiding by the Firmamend Arbiter's will and was strongly against Xianzhou's involvement in the war with the Denizens of Abundance. The Reignbow Sect opined that hiding and defending is not enough to fend off the Denizens of Abundance. For the survival of the Alliance, only by following the path of The Hunt and cleansing the enemy could the future be secured.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― Following consecutive victorious expeditions and the numerous appearances of the Reignbow, the Reignbow Sect slowly gained traction among the people.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― After a mass exodus from their home world, the Vidyadhara join the Xianzhou Alliance.[54]
Year ? BTA/SC ― The Foxians leave their home world and join the Xianzhou Alliance. After the Foxians joined the Alliance, many of them who wished to rebuild their homeland, the Verdant Sect, merged with the Homeward Sect.[54]
4000 BTA/4100 SC ― The Reignbow Arbiter becomes the undisputed main Aeon of the Xianzhou Alliance.[54]
3300 BTA/4800 SC ― The five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. "This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel."[63]
2780 BTA/5320 SC ― The Yuque Divination Commission witnesses the destruction of Muldrasil, the home world of the Wingweavers.[43]
Unknown Time Period
2053 AE ― The execution of Memorykeeper Roy Hampton, likely for his involvement with The Cremators.[64]
2104 AE ― Fomenko, a Candelagraphos scribe, obtains a mute parrot.[65]
The parrot lives for less than a decade, and after its death, Fomenko makes quills out of its feathers.
For a whole Amber Era, Fomenko preserved many ancient documents on the verge of being lost with these quills.
2105 AE ― Fomenko passes away. Many mourned her, saying 'a lamp that illuminated our cosmic past had been snuffed out'. It wasn't until people went over Fomenko's legacy that they finally realized that the scribe had been writing nothing but lies with her quills.[65]
2131 AE ― Xuange Observation Station reported detecting Lan destroying the planet of Xuange from 62 light years away.[66]
Herta observed the incident and nurtured the spiritual form of a Self-Annihilator physician from Xuange in the Simulated Universe.[67]
Oakley was raised on a ranch with her mother and father and spent her time growing up learning how to shoot.
One day, while Oakley was young, a bounty hunter from afar comes to her home and challenges her father to a duel to the death at high noon. The bounty hunter's skill left a strong impression on her after the hunter kills her father, which quickly turned into a lifelong obsession to get revenge.
Using the skills she developed as a child, Oakley set out to become a bounty hunter in an attempt to find him.
She begin to take jobs in remote and far off locations in hopes of running into the hunter.
Oakley quickly became known as the Wild Wheat, and gained a reputation among her fellow bounty hunters as someone who was thoughtless, expressionless, and leaving her opponents with no hope, something she resented.[68]
Oakley boards the Astral Express with her own destination in mind, but with no intention of joining the Crew.[69]
While the Astral Express was journeying close to the border frontier planet of Frati, the former Navigator and passengers all vanished mysteriously due to an anomaly. At the request of the conductor, Oakley temporarily assumes the position of Navigator.
She thwarts numerous attacks from the savage star beasts single-handedly, bringing the Express back to the safety of the Borderstar Trade Zone.
When the Express finally reached safety, she did not immediately step down from her duties. Instead, she assisted in finding more members and searched for the missing individuals.
After approximately six months and two days of serving as Navigator and gathering a sufficient number of new passengers, Oakley leaves the Express, making her the shortest serving Nameless Navigator.
Her exploits would eventually inspire a young Breukelen Tiernan from Frati to join the Express.
On the planet Lushaka in the Przemir system, the seafarers Mikhail and Char adopts a young boy, giving him the name Mikhail Char Legwork.[70]
As the water levels on Lushaka begins to rise, the seafarer Mikhail embarks on an expedition to to ensure that everyone had land to settle on, and continues exploring the sea to search for the source of the rising seawater.[70]
Prison Era
2147 AE ― Hanunue single-handedly masterminds the tumult in the Montour System. The IPC apprehends and sentences him to serve his time in Asdana's frontier prison.[71]
2147 AE ― Stellarons begins to block travel between civilizations.[12]
Falcon Amundsen becomes the Navigator of the Astral Express after Isee departed.[72]
Under Falcon's leadership, the Astral Express regained its former glory, with up to one hundred of passengers at one point.

At the end of the war, with limited resources, threats from the outside world, and internal conflicts between major prison districts, the future of Asdana was uncertain. Penacony decided to take its first step towards expanding the Dreamscape.
The Watchmaker Mikhail approached The Family with the idea of turning the prison into the Planet of Festivities, and Penacony finally gained its name and glory.
The Nightingale Family extends invitations to various architects and memoria scholars across the universe to build the Dreamscape.[85]
Penacony entered an age of rapid development historically known as the Dreamchaser Era.[86]

Mikhail temporarily leaves Penacony for the interstellar frontier to find a way to reconnect Penacony with the rest of the cosmos, sending out invitations across the universe.[88]
The Betrayal
During the period when Mikhail left, civil strife broke out among Penacony's Families, causing much destructive damage to the Dreamscape.
It was at this time the Oak Family Head Gopher Wood declared the "unity of the five major lineages," pushing for all Families to join The Family under the Harmony.
Due to the Nightingale Family's refusal to join, their members were brutally treated by Hounds from the Bloodhound Family, causing the unintentional deaths of the Origami Dreamweavers Joey, Vaughn, and Barlow.
Under pressure, the Nightingale Family Head Glaux resigned his post and founded the Paperfold Academy.
Glaux's student Fischer succeeded his position, and ultimately made the decision to join The Family in order to avoid pointless bloodshed. Orla, another student of Glaux and the youngest of the Origami Dreamweavers, escaped from the Nightingale Family and rebuilt the Dreamflux Reef as a refuge for people disillusioned by the sweet dream.[85]
The Family's representative, using the name of Harmony, exploited people's weaknesses to turn Penacony into the Planet of Festivities, trapping everyone in the illusion of the sweet dream.
After The Family established the Planet of Festivities, the chaotic Primordial Dreamscape was left unchecked.
Mikhail, who returned, exposed their sinister motives, and a handful of people who decided to follow him.
After that, Gallagher used the Enigmata's power to once again activate a Dreamscape separate from The Family's, separating Dreamflux Reef from the Twelve Dreamscapes. He also creates the memory zone meme Dormancy to ferry people out of the Family's dream or vice versa if necessary.
The Family brands Mikhail and his followers as traitors to the Family in secret while continuing to use the Watchmaker's name to publicly advertise Penacony.
Tiernan attempts to return to Penacony several times but is denied entry by the Family. He resigns himself to watching over the Sin Thirsters of the Galaxy Rangers.[74]
Towards the end of his life, Tiernan met the Self-Annihilator Acheron, whom he entrusted his relics to upon finally passing away. Some time afterward, Acheron watches over his Sin Thirster.[74]

68 BTA/8032 SC ― Cherluwoo is born to Yewliho and the Hosing Khan.[113]
Originally, the title of chief would go to Hosing Khan's nephew, Kobo. However, the birth of Cherluwoo had shattered this plan.
After having prepared all his life to inherit the pack, Kobo led the 3,000-strong beast ship fleet that had sworn loyalty to him to reclaim his power and attacked the chief's great beast ship.
Hosing Khan had no time to react before he was murdered by his bodyguards that Kobo had bribed. Naturally, Kobo's next targets would be Yewliho and her son.
Fortunately, Yewliho had always retained her own fleet that vowed loyalty to her, the Preta. Although they only boasted 300 ships, every member was a trusted ally that had accompanied her on pillages for many years.
Yewliho and her fleet successfully forced their way out of Kobo's encirclement. However, there was no way for her mere 300 ships to escape from the huge beast ship fleet that pursued them.

This was on the condition that they comply with all Alliance research on borisin, as well as submitting all beast ship-related technology to them.
This was also the time that Zongguang met Yewliho. As a cultural anthropologist, they were ordered to interview the 127 borisin, in order to deepen the Xianzhou's understanding of borisin society. Throughout the course of their research, Yewliho and Zongguang developed a deep friendship.
Likely because of her hatred towards Kobo, Yewliho always hoped that she would be able to lead her Preta to fight for the Alliance. However, a request like this was unlikely to receive approval. Yewliho made this request again and again and was rejected every time.[113]
~30 Years Before Trailblazer Awakening (BTA)
30 BTA/Year 8070 SC ― After 30 years, she could bear this cycle no longer and began to seek Zongguang's assistance.

Dan Shu's friend Yufei is enlisted in the war and sent to a field hospital on the Fanghu.[114]
Without receiving permission from the Alliance, Yewliho and the Preta launched their final assault, killing an unknown number of Denizens of Abundance.[113]
Diviner Fu Xuan of the Luofu proposes a plan to the Six Charioteers to send out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow, using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, which would be shipped to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger.[115][116]
Just as the Xianzhou faces defeat, the Reignbow Arbiter descends onto the physical plane and annihilates the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, causing collateral damage to the field hospital and killing Yufei.[114]
The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, who was the only person who had the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and could send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree, perishes on the Fanghu.[115]
The previous general of the Yaoqing, who was on the battlefield with the Verdant Knights near the Cloudpeer Telescope, is also killed in the blast.[117]
Yewliho and the Preta managed to transport at least 4,000 civilians to safety before the Reignbow's Lux Arrow descended. During this process, all 127 borisin warriors, including Yewliho perished.[113]
During the course of this battle, the Xianzhou Luofu loses over 63,000 fighter jets and over 120,000 pilots, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves are destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment.

First Meeting	 "Acheron..." Merely a borrowed name. You know my nature, remember my deeds... Thus, I am Acheron.
Greeting	  It's raining... (Trailblazer), care to join me for a walk? Here, I have an umbrella.
Parting	 Our journey begins anew. Life passes like a fleeting rain, eventually merging with the ground. May our next encounter be... under a clear sky.
About Self: Movement	 Lone voyagers in the cosmos are driven by two desires: to tread in the trails of the past, and to forge their own way. But under THEIR scrutiny... most end up adhering to the former.
About Self: Habits	 In the hazy memories of my distant hometown, there were often heavy thunderstorms. Fearing their makeup would be ruined by the rain, girls carried makeup with them wherever they went. I have no reason to do so anymore, but the habit still remains.
About Self: Identity
UI Mission A Walk Among the Tombstones
 Dreams, in essence, are meaningless. Their purpose is painted by the backdrop of life. Yet, if that backdrop is "emptiness"... then dreams are reduced to colorless, hollow shells.
Chat: Rain	 As the raindrops tumble from the crimson leaves, their pitter-patter on my umbrella whispers gently to me. In these moments... I find brief serenity.
Chat: Weapon	 If one carries a blade, it's bound to be used to cut something down. My reason for drawing my sword — past, present, or future — remains singular.
Hobbies: Peaches	 They embody life's delights and pleasures, but are equally fragile and short-lived... Such regret is inevitable, so let it be.
Annoyances	 When I awoke from that place, the sea's horizon still held faint thunder, and the falling blood rain was easing — the sight of that moment lay strikingly clear before me.
Annoyances
UI Mission A Walk Among the Tombstones
 When I awoke from that place, the sea's horizon still held faint thunder, and the falling blood rain was easing — the sight of that moment lay strikingly clear before me. All other memories, both prior and subsequent, paled and slowly ebbed away.
Something to Share: Weapon	 Curious about this blade? When unsheathed, it unveils the memories stored within — every instance I've swung it, in the beginning, the end... and nothingness.
Knowledge: Black Holes	 Black holes aren't spectacular, nor are they fierce. They're silent, like a lone, forlorn gaze watching over you and me... and then gently they consume everything, bestowing a frigid, silent embrace.
Knowledge: Paths	 Seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist... humans traverse the path of fate.
Knowledge: Paths
UI Mission A Walk Among the Tombstones
 Humans traverse the path of fate... seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist...
About (Trailblazer)	  I, too, was once kept in someone's heart like you. Those trivial moments, when looked back upon, are worth more than a thousand words... The past shapes who we are today. Some things are hard to remember, others hard to forget.
About Firefly	 In her, I see the fireflies of the forest, dazzling and bewitching, yet shining only for a brief moment.
About Black Swan	 A lady of elegance and dignity, her benevolent offer lingers in my memory. That dance... it brought me a sense of warmth and nostalgia.
About Aventurine	 A shattered emptiness draped in the guise of desire... his existence is strikingly powerful, yet the self beneath is extraordinarily faint.
About Welt	 There are many types of people called "heroes," and he is among the most genuine... I have seen many such people come and go.
About Sam	 Wherever the fiery giant treads, scorched earth follows. Yet, it's those consumed by unending fire... who, after the flames vanish, quietly hold the ashes in their lonesome embrace.
About Boothill	 Galaxy Ranger... His affiliation with the organization is merely a cover. It's evident that he lives only for himself, and that is exactly why I have faith in him.
Eidolon Activation	 "To cross the same river twice" ...Hardly a hardship.
Character Ascension	 Never turn back — the path behind is gone.
Max Level Reached	 The distant vistas are hazy... but must surely hold beauty.
Trace Activation	 Another blank canvas.
Added to Team With (Trailblazer)	  So it's you... Our time spent with one another is precious.
Added to Team With Black Swan	 Our paths cross once more... Ready for another dance, Memokeeper?
Added to Team With Aventurine	 All or nothing... time will tell.
Added to Team With Welt	 Even before the abyss of a black hole... we still have a choice.
Added to Team With Boothill	 You're fast... hand at the holster already?
Added to Team With Firefly	 You can't escape the past, and neither can I.

Enemy Target Found	 Storm's on the horizon.
Returning to Town	 This haven of memories, every touch, every moment is like a thorned rose...
